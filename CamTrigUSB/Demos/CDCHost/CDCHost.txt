/** \mainpage CDC Host Demo
 *  
 *  CDC host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a USB CDC host, for CDC devices using the standard ACM profile.
 *  
 *  This demo prints out received CDC data through the serial port.
 *  
 *  Not that this demo is only compatible with devices which report the correct CDC
 *  and ACM class, subclass and protocol values. Most USB-Serial cables have vendor
 *  specific features, thus use vendor-specfic class/subclass/protocol codes to force
 *  the user to use specialized drivers. This demo is not compaible with such devices.
