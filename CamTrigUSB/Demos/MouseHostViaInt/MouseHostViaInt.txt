/** \mainpage Mouse Host Demo
 *  
 *  Mouse host demonstration application, using pipe interrupts. This
 *  gives a simple reference application for implementing a USB Mouse
 *  host utilizing the LUFA pipe interrupt system, for USB mice using
 *  the standard mouse HID profile.
 *  
 *  Mouse movement and button presses are displayed on the board LEDs,
 *  as well as printed out the serial terminal as formatted dY, dY and
 *  button status information.
 *  
 *  This uses a naive method where the mouse is set to Boot Protocol mode, so
 *  that the report structure is fixed and known. A better implementation
 *  uses the HID report parser for correct report data processing across
 *  all compatable mice with advanced characteristics, as shown in the
 *  MouseHostWithParser demo application.
 *  
 *  Currently only single interface mice are supported.
