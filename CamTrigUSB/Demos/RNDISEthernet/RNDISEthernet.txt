/** \mainpage RNDIS Class Ethernet Demo (with Webserver/Telnet)
 *  
 *  Remote Network Driver Interface demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a CDC RNDIS device acting as a simple network interface for
 *  ethernet packet exchange. RNDIS is a proprietary Microsoft
 *  standard; this demo will only work on Windows 2000 (manually
 *  patched with the Microsoft RNDIS hotfix) and above (with no
 *  manual patches), or on the latest Linux kernels.
 *  
 *  Before running, you will need to install the INF file that
 *  is located in the RNDISEthernet project directory. This will
 *  enable Windows to use its inbuilt RNDIS drivers, negating the
 *  need for special Windows drivers for the device. To install,
 *  right-click the .INF file and choose the Install option. If
 *  Windows 2000 is used, the Microsoft INF file in the hotfix
 *  will need to be altered to use the VID/PID of the demo and
 *  then chosen instead of the LUFA RNDIS INF file when prompted.
 *  
 *  When enumerated, this demo will install as a new network
 *  adapter which ethernet packets can be sent to and received
 *  from. Running on top of the adapter is a very simple TCP/IP
 *  stack with a HTTP webserver and TELNET host which can be
 *  accessed through a web browser at IP address 10.0.0.2:80 or
 *  through a TELNET client at 10.0.0.2:25. This device also supports
 *  ping echos via the ICMP protocol.
 *  
 *  \note The TCP/IP stack in this demo has a number of limitations
 *  and should serve as an example only - it is not fully featured nor
 *  compliant to the TCP/IP specification. For complete projects, it is 
 *  recommended that it be replaced with an external open source TCP/IP
 *  stack that is feature complete, such as the uIP stack.
