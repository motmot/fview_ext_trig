/** \mainpage Mass Storage Host Demo
 *  
 *  Mass Storage host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mass Storage host, for USB storage devices
 *  using the standard Mass Storage USB profile.
 *  
 *  The first 512 bytes (boot sector) of an attached disk's memory will be dumped
 *  out of the serial port in HEX and ASCII form when it is attached to the AT90USB1287
 *  AVR. The device will then wait for HWB to be pressed, whereupon the entire ASCII contents
 *  of the disk will be dumped to the serial port.
