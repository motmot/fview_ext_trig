/** \mainpage Keyboard Host Demo
 *  
 *  Keyboard host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mouse keyboard, for USB keyboards using
 *  the standard keyboard HID profile.
 *  
 *  Pressed alpha-numeric, enter or space key is transmitted through the serial
 *  USART at serial settings 9600, 8, N, 1.
 *  
 *  This uses a naive method where the keyboard is set to Boot Protocol mode, so
 *  that the report structure is fixed and known. A better implementation
 *  uses the HID report parser for correct report data processing across
 *  all compatable mice with advanced characteristics, as shown in the
 *  KeyboardHostWithParser demo application.
 *  
 *  Currently only single interface keyboards are supported.
