 *  \mainpage About the LUFA (Formerly MyUSB) Library
 *
 *  Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs Library, written by Dean Camera.
 *
 *  \section Sec_About About this library
 *
 *  Originally based on the AT90USBKEY from Atmel, it is an open-source, driver for the USB-enabled AVR
 *  microcontrollers, released under the MIT license. Currently, the AT90USB1286, AT90USB1287, AT90USB646,
 *  AT90USB647, AT90USB162, AT90USB82, ATMEGA16U4, ATMEGA32U6 and ATMEGA32U4 AVR microcontrollers are supported by the 
 *  library. Supported premade boards are the USBKEY, STK525, STK526, RZUSBSTICK and ATAVRUSBRF01.
 *
 *  The library is currently in a stable release, suitable for download and incorporation into user projects for
 *  both host and device modes. For information about the project progression, check out my blog.
 *
 *  LUFA is written specifically for the free AVR-GCC compiler, and uses several GCC-only extensions to make the
 *  library API more streamlined and robust. You can download AVR-GCC for free in a convenient windows package, 
 *  from the the WinAVR website.

 *  \section Sec_Demos Demos and Bootloaders
 *  The LUFA library ships with several different host and device demos, located in the /Demos/ subdirectory.
 *  If this directory is missing, please re-download the project from the project homepage.
 *
 *  Also included with the library are two fully functional bootloaders, loacated in the /Bootloaders/ subdirectory.
 *  The DFU class bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer project, and
 *  the CDC class (AVR109 protocol) is compatible with such open source software as AVRDUDE and AVR-OSP.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Donations Donate
 *  I am a 20 year old University student studying for a double degree in Computer Science and Electronics
 *  Engineering. This leaves little time for any sort of work or leisure. Please consider donating a small amount
 *  to myself to support this and my future Open Source projects. You can donate any amount via PayPal on my
 *  website, http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com . All donations are greatly appreciated.
