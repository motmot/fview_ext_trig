/** \mainpage DFU Class USB AVR Bootloader
 *  
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a DFU Class device, allowing for DFU-compatible programming
 *  software to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *  
 *  This bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP application. However, it requires the use of Atmel's
 *  DFU drivers. You will need to install Atmel's DFU drivers prior to using this bootloader.
 *  
 *  As an open-source option, this bootloader is also compatible with the Linux Atmel USB DFU Programmer
 *  software, available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/.
 *  
 *  If SECURE_MODE is defined as true, upon startup the bootloader will be locked, with only the chip erase
 *  function available (similar to Atmel's DFU bootloader). If SECURE_MODE is defined as false, all functions 
 *  are usable on startup without the prerequisite firmware erase.
 *  
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and should fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 *  you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 *  values in the accompanying makefile.
 *  
 *  <b>NOTE:</b> This device spoofs Atmel's DFU Bootloader USB VID and PID so that the Atmel DFU bootloader
 *               drivers included with FLIP will work. If you do not wish to use Atmel's ID codes, please
 *               manually change them in Descriptors.c and alter your driver's INF file accordingly.
